# Lorien

Lorien is my personal version of LinkTree.

In J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, Lothl√≥rien is a forest realm of the Elves. It's known for its enchanting beauty and tranquility, and it's also a place where travelers can find rest and respite. The word "lorien" itself means "dream" or "vision" in the Elvish language Sindarin. As the name suggests, I hope that this site will be a portal to different places and experiences for those who visit it.
